# GFT

The Green Feeding Tool (GFT) is an online plus excel-based tool that provides country level information on the carbon footprint and water footprint arising from current infant feeding practices   in the first six months of life. Estimates are based  on the annual number of births, local feeding patterns for infants  under six months, eating patterns of mothers, and the related carbon footprint of these practices. GFT can support advocacy and decision-making to generate effective action.  Together with the existing  evidence on  effective interventions to  improve breastfeeding practices, the GFT will provide the data required to develop the business case for investing in  breastfeeding protection, promotion, and support as a ‘carbon offset’ strategy. The main users of GFT will be donors, policy makers, advocates, healthcare providers, researchers, program implementers, and individual caregivers.
